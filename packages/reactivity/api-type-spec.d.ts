// === Core Ref ===

// Note: Mora uses the term `Ref` to describe a reactive value container with `get`, `set`, and `subscribe`.
// While the broader ecosystem is gravitating toward the term `Signal`, we find `Ref` to be more intuitive
// for most JavaScript developers â€” especially those familiar with patterns from Vue or React. `Ref` emphasizes
// the value-centric, container-like nature of the primitive rather than its signaling behavior.
// Mora prioritizes clarity and ergonomic mental models over strict ecosystem alignment.
// Despite the naming difference, Mora's `Ref` API closely aligns with the TC39 proposal for signals.
