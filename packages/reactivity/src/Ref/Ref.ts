/**
 * The `Ref` interface is the core reactive object in Mora. A ref instance holds a value
 * and allows you to subscribe to changes to that value. Accessing a ref's value will
 * register it as a dependency in the current tracking context if one exists. Setting a
 * ref's value will notify all subscribers of the change and trigger any dependent
 * computations or effects.
 *
 * @privateRemarks
 * Though the `Ref` interface is modeled after the TC39 Signals proposal, we opted to
 * use the term "ref" for a few reasons that we acknowledge are largely author preference:
 * - Ref is already an established term in the language itself (see {@link WeakRef})
 * - Mora refs have more functionality than the Signal described in the proposal; they
 *   come with a built-in subscription model based on the TC39 Observable proposal
 * - We believe first and foremost that — to the consumer — this primitive is a value and
 *   reactivity is an emergent behavior of the value, not the sole purpose of it
 * - "Signal" puts an overt focus on the concept of notifying downstream dependencies, but
 *   in the proposal, the subscription mechanism is hidden from the consumer, so why do
 *   they care to think about it this way?
 *
 * The term "signal" may have a place in the mental model of library authors, but as a means
 * of notifying subscribers, we believe "observable" fits into the mental model of the
 * consumer better. To this end, Mora's refs can be thought of as the union of "signals" and
 * "observables" packaged with the consumer in mind.
