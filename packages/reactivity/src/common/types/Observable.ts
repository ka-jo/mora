/**
 * @privateRemarks
 * Mora uses the Observable as the core primitive for its reactive philosophy internally.
 * Externally, this will be represented as a Ref, but internally, the Observable is the
 * primitive that is common to all features/namespaces.
 *
 * Mora's philosophy is that the chief concern of reactivity is the ability to subscribe
 * to data â€” not necessarily the means of retrieving and updating it.
 *
 * Mora's Observable is meant to mirror the TC39 proposal and the larger Observable
 * ecosystem as a whole, but due to the fact that Refs are the only observable type in
 * Mora and are a much more focused use case, there are some notable divergences:
 * - Mora has no concept of "unicast" observables; Refs are multicast by design
 * - Mora has no concept of "hot" or "cold" observables; Refs are hot by design
 * - The `error` callback can be called multiple times; just because a Ref encounters an
 *   error doesn't mean it can't recover or that it stops existing
 * - All Observables in Mora produce values and some Observables must be computed to get the
 *   most recent value
 * - Observers subscribe to *future* values, not current values
 *
 * This Observable type is meant to model how Observables are used internally in Mora,
 * not necessarily how Observables are used by the ecosystem as a whole.
